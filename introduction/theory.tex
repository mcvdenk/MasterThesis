\chapter{Theoretical Framework}

%Introduction chapter

%Make clear that we are talking about Declarative Semantic knowledge

%General memory theory
    %Areas of the brain involved
    %Sensory store, and short-term (or working) and long-term memory
    %Encoding: transition working to long-term
    %Retrieval: transition long-term to working
    %Retrieval is the goal, and encoding is the purpose

    %Concept mapping is an encoding practice, where the flashcard system is a retrieval practice

%Flashcard system
    %First form of flashcards
    %Cognitive theory
        %Spacing effect
        %Effect on flashcards
        %Long term potentiation
            %Power law of learning and forgetting
            %Decay theory vs Interference theory
        %Effect on flashcards
            %Pimsleur system
            %Leitner system
    %Practical studies
        %Attitude
        %Effectiveness
    %Criticism
