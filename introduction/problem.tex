\chapter{Project Description}

\label{ch:problem}

Over the centuries, knowledge has been fundamental to any learning process. Socrates already stated that knowledge is the only true virtue, and the tragedian Aeschylus regarded memory as the mother of all knowledge. Moreover, it was not only regarded as important by ancient thinkers, but is still regarded as such by modern scholars on education. Both the taxonomy of learning by \citeA{bloom} as a revision of this taxonomy by \citeA{krathwohl}, as well as the three stages of skill acquisition by \citeA{skillacquisition}, propose that all learning should start with memorising factual knowledge. Furthermore, \citeA{glaserfield}, one of the main founders for critical constructivism, expresses a need for training students so that they permanently possess facts and are able to repeat them flawlessly whenever they are needed, while also understanding what is placed into their memory. \citeA{ltwm} adds to this by stating that in order to perform complex tasks, people must maintain access to large amounts of information, and that solely encoding knowledge is not sufficient. Despite all of this, \citeA{karpicke4} argues that "[r]etrieval processes, the processes involved in using available cues to actively reconstruct knowledge, have received less attention" (p. 158), whereas basic research on learning and memory has emphasised that retrieval must be considered in any analysis of learning.

Traditionally, when students have to gain complex and meaningful knowledge -- for example knowledge about a historical event or a chapter in a psychology textbook, they are asked to read the relevant chapter from a provided textbook. However, \citeA{learninginstruction} states that many students have difficulty gaining knowledge in this manner. He breaks reading for comprehension down into four separate skills, which are integrating, organising, elaborating, and monitoring. Integrating refers to relating a text to one's prior knowledge, for which exists evidence that rich background knowledge leads to better inferences about the text, and thereby better comprehension. After integration, the reader has to organise the text, so that the important ideas and the relatinoships among them are identified. This is mainly a problem for less experienced readers, which will spend too much time on reading the unimportant information. At the same time, the student has to make necessary inferences while reading, or has to elaborate, which is quite difficult for readers when not prompted. Finally, students have to monitor their comprehension, which refers to evaluating comprehension of the text and if necessary adjusting the reading strategy. This is again quite difficult for the average reader, however can be trained.

While intergrating is something more dependent on the curriculum design, organising and elaborating can be facilitated by concept mapping, and monitoring by flashcard systems. Furthermore, this research aims to develop a tool which combines these tools, called the flashmap. In this chapter, concept mapping, flashcard systems, and the flashmap will be explored on a practical level in order to establish their definitions together with a summary of arguments in favour or opposition of using them as tools for studying textual material.

\section{Flashcard system}

\subsection{Definition}

In the context of language learning, \citeA{nakata} define flashcard systems where ``target items are presented outside meaning-focused tasks, and learners are asked to associate the L2 [foreign language] word form with its meaning, usually in the form of a first language translation, L2 synonym, or L2 definition'' (p. 17). This form of learning is also refered to as a \emph{paired-associate format}, which refers to learning by being presented by cues and the learner having to recall an associated counterpart. Therefore, the following general definition is proposed:

\begin{definition}
A flashcard system refers to any system in which a learner is presented by cues and has to recall answers from an paired-associate format.
\end{definition}

The most simple form of a flashcard system is a system where the learner has a stack of cards, with each containing a retrieval cue on one side and the correct associated response on the other side. He can then study by going through the whole stack each day, trying to come up with the correct answer. He can then increase its efficiency by repeating difficult cards more often, or skipping reviewing certain easy cards for multiple days. This way he focuses only on the pairs which are more needy of retrieval. Finally, he can choose to not start with the whole stack on the first day, but increase the size of the stack over multiple days in order to improve the spreading of cognitive load. Next to these paper flashcards there is also a multitude of digital flashcard systems available \cite{hwang2, nakata, microlearning}, which allows for automating the rescheduling of flashcards, making it possible to create more advanced mechanisms.

\subsection{Effectiveness}

Flashcard systems have not been completely free from criticism by other researchers. \citeA{hulstijn} for example describes flashcards as a relic of the old-fashioned behaviourist learning model, and \citeA{mccullough} states that the main emphasis of flashcards is memorisation, not comprehension. However, \citeA{zirkle} states that it is still important for teachers and students to understand and utilise memory in such a way that a store of knowledge is produced that remains flexibly retrievable in a variety of contexts over a period of time, even more so because even though it is deemed useless to learn without comprehension, students still should learn by heart many conventional facts \cite{glaserfield}. Flashcards have found to be both a time efficient tool for learning large numbers of facts and an effective tool for these facts to be more resistant to decay in comparison to traditional teaching methods \cite{nakata}. They have also been found to be effective accross studies in different contexts, for example that of language learning \cite{chien, nakata, macquarrie, mccullough}, word recognition \cite{joseph}, psychology courses \cite{burgess, golding}, and geography \cite{zirkle}. Therefore, many authors support pursuing research into flashcards and its effective application into classrooms.

\subsection{Design features}

\citeA{nakata} also describe general design features of flashcard software, which are seperated in terms of creation and editing of flashcards, and learning of flashcards. These entail features whether learners are able to create their own flashcards or flashcard sets, whether learners merely have to recall an answer or have to produce an answer, how big a learning session is and how repetitions are scheduled. Partly, these features are also applicable on paper flashcards. The features will be further elaborated later on page INSERT REFERENCE TO DESIGN CHAPTER, but for now it is sufficient to state that there do not exist commonly accepted guidelines for how flaschard software should be designed. This mainly is due to the fact that not a lot of research is conducted on specific design-features, research reviewing mostly the same program, and there being discrepancies in the way they are designed, and further research is needed in order to establish these guidelines.

%TODO: add reference to design chapter

\subsection{Application of flashcards}

Multiple sources describe an increase in the use of flashcards in education: \citeA{kornell} states that ``perhaps no memorisation technique is more widely used than flashcards'' (p. 125), and more recently textbooks have also started making them available \cite{burgess, golding}. \citeA{golding} provides two reasons for the popularity of flashcards: students can generate flashcards for themselves, they feel taht they are `doing' something when they study. Most of the studies found is based around flashcard usage in language courses \cite{nakata, joseph, chien}, but there also exists a study by \citeA{golding} describing that 70\% of general psychology students used flashcards for at least one exam.

\citeA{chien} and \citeA{nakata} describe that multimedia and digital flashcards are used very widely, because they can be easily programmed to keep track of performance and better control the sequency, which is cumbersome if done manually, and that students might be more motivated using digital flashcards because of the enhanced presentation of materials due to their multimedia capabilities. However, \citeA{golding} still found the majority of students using written flashcards. These findings surprised \citeA{burgess}, since many students have their smart phones with them most of the time -- 75\% of students report using smartphones during breaks, meetings etc, 55\% while waiting, and 45\% for school related uses -- and phones are more portable than large stacks of traditional flashcards. However, when he pursued the study by providing students with either written or digital flashcards, students used the digital flashcards less frequently than the traditional flashcards, even when the students had to make their own flashcards. Reasons students provided were technical issues such as battery consumption, simply forgetting about it, using entertainment apps instead of studying, and preference for traditional flashcards.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FROM THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL (TODO: DELETE LATER) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%In the context of language learning, \citeA{nakata} defines a flashcard system as ``Target items [...] presented outside meaning-focused tasks, [where] learners are asked to associate the L2 [foreign] word form with its meaning, usually in the form of a first language translation, L2 synonym, or L2 definition'' (p. 17). In a generalised form, a flashcard system contains pairs by association, where the student is presented by one member of the pair and has to recall the other. This pair can indeed consist out of words in different languages, but can also consist out of a picture and a word for learning spelling, or a question with an answer for learning history. Traditionally, these pairs were presented as small cards (hence the name), and students would spend each day going through the stack of cards, preparing themselves for their exams.

%\section{Problem statement}

%n1.1.7, n1.1.3

%Both the taxonomy of learning by \citeA{bloom} as a revision of this taxonomy by \citeA{krathwohl}, as well as the three stages of skill acquisition by \citeA{skillacquisition}, propose that all learning should start with memorising factual knowledge. Furthermore, \citeA{glaserfield}, one of the main founders for critical constructivism, expresses a need for training students so that they permanently possess facts and are able to repeat them flawlessly whenever they are needed, while also understanding what is placed into their memory. \citeA{ltwm} adds to this by stating that in order to perform complex tasks, people must maintain access to large amounts of information, and that solely encoding knowledge is not sufficient. Despite this, \citeA{karpicke4} argues that "[r]etrieval processes, the processes involved in using available cues to actively reconstruct knowledge, have received less attention" (p. 158), whereas basic research on learning and memory has emphasised that retrieval must be considered in any analysis of learning. Therefore, this project aims to research a tool for meaningfully enhancing the retrieval process. 

%\citeA{karpicke4} also states that meaningful learning often is defined in contrast to rote learning, and that active retrieval is thought of as an example of the latter leading to poorly organised knowledge that lacks coherence and integration. However, in another study they found active retrieval to enhance learning of meaningful educational materials and that these effects are long-lasting, not short-lived \cite{karpicke2}. In this study, he compared the effects of active retrieval using measures of meaningful learning contrasting to a popular learning strategy known as concept mapping. The latter involves a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes \cite{ruiz1} (see figure~\ref{fig:conceptmap}). Multiple researchers have found by means of both qualitative and quantitative studies that concept maps can promote meaningful learning leading to positive effects on students \cite{hwang2, subramaniam, canas}. This has been demonstrated in comparison to activities such as reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions \cite{singh, nesbit2}. \citeA{canas} describes the process of concept mapping as the only effective way of using the concept map, which refers to students constructing their own concept maps. This is why the concept map is generally viewed as a tool in alignment with the constructivist perspective. Because of this, the concept map might seem as a solution to the need asked by \citeA{glaserfield} and his peers. However, the aforementioned article by \citeA{karpicke2} reveals that retrieval practices produced better performance than elaborative concept mapping for meaningful learning.

%One of the currently existing methods for efficiently rote memorising information is the flashcard system, which entails studying declarative knowledge using active retrieval in a so-called paired-associate format. Within this format, learners are asked to associate terms with other terms outside meaning-focused tasks \cite{nakata}, for example by associating a definition with a presented concept. With flashcards, large numbers of words can be memorised in a very short time, and are more resistant to decay \cite{nakata, joseph}. Furthermore, when evaluating flashcards in a psychology setting, it was found that students who use flashcards have a significantly higher final average than those who do not \cite{burgess, golding}.

%EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM

%n1.1.2, n1.1.3.2, n1.1.3.8, n1.5.9, n1.2.1.2
%Per contra, not all research favours using flashcards for textual comprehension. \citeA{zirkle} and \citeA{mccullough} state that flashcards are especially useful for learning declarative knowledge but not for textual comprehension. \citeA{zirkle} points out the overemphasis placed upon the rote memorisation of disconnected facts, whereas whatever it is that students are to place into memory they should, more importantly, understand. Furthermore, \citeA{hulstijn} describes flashcards as a relic of the old-fashioned behaviourist learning model, and states that we have to look for more modern constructivist models.

%EXPLAIN WHY THE PROBLEM IS IMPORTANT

%n1.1.1.7
%Solving these problems could lead to better utilisation by teachers and students of producing a store of knowledge that remains flexibly retrievable, in contrast to only segregated paired associations which depend on specific cues in order to be retrieved. Furthermore, using computer-based flashcards have been used very widely \cite{nakata,burgess, golding,kornell}, and improving currently existing flashcards could reach a wide audience of future users of flashcard systems.

%PROPOSE A SOLUTION/IDEA AND ITS BENEFITS

%introduction flashmaps

%n1.2.6.8 and n1.2.6.9 (Counterarguments), n1.2.5, n1.2.10
%Therefore, another solution might be the development of a new tool, which will from henceforth be referred to as the flashmap system. The intention behind the flashmap system is to combine the paired associate mechanism of the flashcard system with the visual representation of the concept map, and is a new tool designed and developed for this research project. This tool might have the potential to bridge the gap between the two systems and therefore make meaningful and effective rote memorisation possible, for it makes the relations between the concepts explicit to the student and thereby increasing the organisation of the knowledge and reducing the segregation of facts. Thereby, it might provide a solution for the problems by \citeA{zirkle} described before.
