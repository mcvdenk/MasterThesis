\section{Outputs}

%Include descriptions and target dates for final outputs (e.g., advice reports, delivery of products, scientific article) as well as those along the way (e.g. literature review; instruments; data collection).

Their are several products being developed and data being collected during the project. First of all, a concept map will be developed containing the main concepts on 17th century Dutch literature, which will be the basis for the flashcards and the item bank questions. Furthermore, software will be developed being capable of both providing flashcards and flashmaps. The data being collected includes initial and final student answers, questionnaire results audio conversations, and server logs from the interviews, which will then be used for conducting the t-tests and triangulation and expansion purposes. This will finally be documented in the research report.
