\chapter{Analyses}

\label{ch:analysis}

Before designing an educational product, it is important that the designer first acquaints himself with the extrinsic factors important to this product. In order to discover the important characteristics of these factors, \citeA{instructionaldesign} enlist three types of analyses to be conducted, together with steps for conducting them. These are an analysis of the context, encompassing the needs of the users, and the environmental characteristics, an analysis of the learner, and an analysis of the learning task. Although these analyses are more targeted towards instructional design, and therefore more focused on a specific group being taught specific content, these analyses will still provide relevant information for the design choices and the evaluation. However, the steps will be adjusted and generalised or even omitted in order to fit the design of the more generic learning tool.
