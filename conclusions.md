Note on small sample size

## Is the learning gain larger?

- Indication of higher flashmap score on knowledge questions (not significant)
- Indication of higher flaschard score on comprehension section within ctt (not significant)
- Indication of higher flashmap score on comprehension section within irt (low validity, significant)
- Hypotheses:
    - Random outcome
    - If indeed larger flashcard comprehension score than flashmap:
        - Phrasing of question having an effect
        - Explicit relations inhibit constructing meaning within the user (generative vs supplantive)

## Is the learning gain larger controlled for the time spent on the system?

- Less material covered by flashmap users (non-significant)
    - Random outcome because of two outliers within flashmap (based on histogram)
- More time spent by flashmap users (significant)
    - Retrieval is easier with flashmap, therefore smaller time per flashmap
- Less time spent per flashmap presentation than per flashcard presentation (significant)
    - More edges, therefore more navigation time and overall time spent

## Do they perceive the system to be more useful?

- Higher perceived usefulness by flashmap users (low validity and non significant)
- General:
    - Structure provided by instances
    - Distribution of learning over period of time
    - Repetition of questions
    - Instances repeated too often
    - Specifics of the content covered (not relevant)

## Do they perceive the system to be easier to use?

- Higher perceived usefulness by flashmap users (non significant)
- General:
    - Better instructions needed
    - Navigation sometimes tedious for flashmap users
    - Rigid

## How did the students use the flashmap or flashcard system?

- Flashmap significantly less responses per instance
- No difference in mean instance progress
- Correct retrieval rate around 0.87
- Flashmap significantly higher correct retrievals per instance
    - Maybe because unclear instructions on marking as correct/incorrect
