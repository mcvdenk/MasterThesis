Planning thesis
===============

* Concept map of thesis for explicitating links

Introduction
------------

* ~~Weeding~~
* ~~Describe links (with other chapters)~~
* ~~Incorporate feedback~~

Design
------

* Reduce analysis to implications + incorporation system
* Approach software description from user experience (current client chapter)
* Move current server description to documentation

Research
--------

* Weeding
* Describe links (with other chapters)
* Incorporate feedback


* Results: tables on user participation
* Conclusion:
  * Answering the research questions based on bullet points
  * Limitations
    * Low response rate
    * No controlled experiment
    * No formative evaluation of prototype
  * Future work (maybe separate part)
    * More generative
      * Students constructing the concept map/flashcards
      * Connection game suggested by cannas
    * Scheduling
      * Based on time interval between previous and current response
      * Probabilistic
    * Visualisation of the concept map
    * More supported displays (tables etc.)
    * Combination of multiple displays
