Research
--------

* Method:
  * Research design
  * Respondents
  * Instrumentation
    * Test design
  * Procedure
  * Analysis
    * Quantitative
      * Classical reliability measure
      * IRT reliability measure
      * ANOVA on learning gain
      * ANOVA on IRT theta's of learning gain
      * Learning gain relative and absolute
      * Measures for comparing the groups
        * Times spent with tool
        * Amount of flashcards/edges processed
        * Comparison of learning progress
        * IRT thetas in pretest
      * Questionnaire
    * Qualitative
      * Interviews (steps of Baarda)
      * Questionnaire open questions
* Results:
  * Descriptives
  * Quantitative results
    * Classical reliability
    * IRT reliability
    * ANOVA on learning gain
    * ANOVA on IRT theta's of learning gain
    * Learning gain relative and absolute
    * Times spent with tool
    * Amount of flashcards/edges processed
    * Comparison of learning progress
    * IRT thetas in pretest
    * Questionnaire
  * Qualitative results
    * Interviews (steps of Baarda)
    * Questionnaire open questions
* Conclusion:
  * Answering the research question
  * Hypotheses for explaining the results
    * Less elaborative processing
    * Cognitive load differences
    * Results due to measuring error
    * Phrasing of the question (for example the effect of the question mark)
  * Limitations
  * Future work (maybe separate part)
    * More generative
      * Students constructing the concept map/flashcards
      * Connection game suggested by cannas
    * Scheduling
      * Based on time interval between previous and current response
      * Probabilistic
    * Visualisation of the concept map
    * More supported displays (tables etc.)
    * Combination of multiple displays
