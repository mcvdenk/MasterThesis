Each recall cue mentioned some property of a target word's referent, a property which was not explicitly identified during input. Cues were more effective when the properties were relevant, rather than irrelevant, to the events described by corresponding acquisition sentences. The research raised considerations pertinent to theories of semantic encoding, to semantic theories in linguistics, and to the role of normative data in psycholinguistic theories of comprehension."
